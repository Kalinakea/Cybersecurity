# Cybersecurity
Highly motivated and detail-oriented cybersecurity analyst with strong time management skills and a solid foundation in programming logic. Demonstrates a high standard of ethical conduct and a strong interest in identifying and analyzing potential security risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets.

These strengths enable me to effectively protect sensitive information and mitigate risks through the use of ethical methodologies, security controls, and best practices using SIEM tools.

Data is a powerful asset, and when it falls into the wrong hands, it can cause significant harm. For this reason, I believe it is essential to create a secure environment in which users can navigate and trust that their information is protected, especially in today’s era where everything and everyone is interconnected.
